#Initial Setup Instructions:

* Create a new non-networked printer using the new printer wizard and
select 'Custom FFF printer'.  Give it a name such as
'FlashForge Adventurer 4' and click next.  Enter all the information
requested by copying the screenshots provided.  For G-Code you can 
simply copy the contents of the provided G-Code text files and paste
them in their respective windows.

#Printing Profiles:

* A 0.2mm Draft profile has been included, simply import the profile
via Manage Printer(s).  These profiles will be modified to reflect
the capabilities of the printer.  Modifications such as print and 
travel speeds have been modified to 50mm/s and 70mms/ respectively.

#Post-Processing Scripts:

* Initial script included is FlashForgeAdapter.py which allows for
proper FlashPrint loading of G-Code as well as accurate real-time
printing status via the display of the printer.  More enhancements
are to come as proper thumbnail support, etc... stay tuned!
